1. INTRODUCTION & SCOPE
DialMaster – Smart Auto Dialer & Call Assistant (“DialMaster”, “App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is designed to help users organize outbound calling workflows and launch calls using the device’s native dialer (ACTION_DIAL). DialMaster intentionally collects minimal personal data and treats all user contact lists, call notes, and call outcomes as local, device‑only data unless explicitly stated otherwise. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have about your information.

This Policy applies to users of DialMaster on Android and iOS and to any data processed by our backend systems (Firebase / Google Cloud) for account, subscription, and monetization purposes.

Acceptance: By installing or using DialMaster you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not install or use the App.

2. APP IDENTITY, PURPOSE & PROCESSING SCOPE
App name: DialMaster – Smart Auto Dialer & Call Assistant
Developer: Abhishek Rajput (ZeengoCorp)
Support email: support@dialmaster.in

Primary purpose: Provide a semi‑automatic call queueing experience that launches calls through the device’s system dialer. Key features include contact import (device only), call sequencing, call outcome notes, rewarded coins via ads, and paid subscriptions for ad removal and premium features.

Supported platforms: Android and iOS. Where platform requirements differ (e.g., billing flow), platform‑specific terms may apply.

3. DEFINITIONS
• “Personal Data” — information that identifies or can reasonably identify an individual.
• “Device Data” — information generated by the user’s device or stored locally (contacts, notes).
• “RTB” — real‑time bidding for ad auctions.
• “SDK” — software development kit, third‑party code integrated into the App.
• “Controller/Processor” — DialMaster developer acts as controller for account/subscription data; ad networks act as controllers/processors for ad‑related data as described below.

4. DATA WE COLLECT — DETAILED
We limit data collection to the minimum necessary to operate, monetize, and improve the App. Categories below list the typical items collected and the source.

A. Data collected via Google Sign‑In / Authentication
• Google account ID (Firebase UID)
• Google display name
• Google email address
• Profile image URL (optional)
Purpose: Account identity, subscription mapping, purchase verification, and support.
Stored: Firebase Authentication & Firestore (server). See Section 11 for retention.

B. Device‑local data (stored only on-device — NEVER uploaded)
• Contacts imported by the user (CSV/XLSX import or device contact access when user chooses)
• Call notes and call outcomes added by the user
• Local coins balance and transaction history used by the app
Storage: Room (Android) / local encrypted database (iOS) — not transmitted to our servers except where user explicitly performs a server action (e.g., backup enabled — see optional backup clause below).

C. Automatically collected technical and analytics data
Collected by integrated SDKs and our telemetry:
• Device model, OS version, app version
• Advertising Identifier (GAID / IDFA)
• IP address (used for approximate location and fraud detection)
• Crash reports and stack traces
• App events (screens visited, features used, ad impressions & clicks)
• Subscription events and purchase tokens (for verification)
• Rewarded ad validation events and fraud markers
Note: Some of the above items are collected by third‑party SDKs (Firebase, AdMob, MAX, Prebid) as controllers/processors; see Section 9 for details.

D. Monetization & purchase data
• Purchase token / transaction ID (Google Play / App Store)
• Subscription plan identifier and expiry/renewal date
• Coin purchase history (for auditing/fraud prevention)
These items are necessary to enforce subscription status and validate purchases.

E. Consent / preference data
• UMP consent string or IAB consent string (EU/UK users)
• Ad personalization preference (Personalized / Non‑personalized)
• CCPA do‑not‑sell / share flag for California residents

5. DATA WE DO NOT COLLECT (ASSURANCES)
We explicitly do NOT collect, store, or transmit the following:
• Call logs (incoming/outgoing call history)
• Call recordings or microphone audio captured by us
• SMS or messages (sent/received)
• Contact lists uploaded to our servers (unless user opts in to an explicit backup feature; see optional backup clause)
• Background call activity or hidden dialing
• Precise GPS location (we may use IP‑derived approximate location for geo‑targeted ads; explicit location will not be accessed)
• Sensitive personal data (e.g., health, biometric data, race, religion)

6. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING (EU/GDPR)
Where applicable, we process data on the following legal bases:
• Consent — for personalized advertising, UMP consent collection, and optional backups.
• Contract performance — processing necessary to provide in‑app subscriptions, purchases and account management.
• Legitimate interests — fraud prevention, app analytics, product improvement (balanced with user rights).
Users in the EU can object to processing on legitimate interest grounds; to exercise this right, contact support.

7. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
We use collected data for the following purposes:
• Authentication & account management (Google Sign‑In)
• Subscription management, billing verification and entitlement enforcement
• Display and validation of rewarded ad credits (coins)
• Deliver ads (personalized or non‑personalized depending on consent)
• App analytics and crash diagnostics to improve quality and reliability
• Fraud prevention and reward validation to deter fraudulent behavior
• Customer support and policy enforcement
We do not use device‑local contacts or notes for advertising or analytics unless an explicit and separate consent is provided.

8. ADVERTISING, MEDIATION, HEADER‑BIDDING & RTB
To monetize the free offering, DialMaster integrates multiple ad partners using mediation and header‑bidding. This means ad requests may enter real‑time auctions where demand partners process device and contextual information. Typical data processed for ad auctions includes:
• IP address, device model, OS, app version
• Advertising ID (GAID/IDFA)
• Ad unit ID and ad request metadata
• Basic app usage signals (ad impressions, clicks, engagement)
Real‑time bidding partners may also receive timestamped signals used to optimize auctions.

Consent & personalization
• EU/EEA/UK: We use Google UMP and IAB TCF comformant flows to capture consent. Personalized ads require explicit opt‑in consent.
• California: We provide a CCPA Do‑Not‑Sell/Share toggle and honor opt‑out requests.

9. THIRD‑PARTY SERVICES & SDKS (EXAMPLES)
We use, and may update, the following third‑party services which each have their own privacy practices (this list is representative — check app settings or the “Advertising Partners We Work With” page for the live partner list):
• Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Analytics, Crashlytics)
• Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) & Google Ad Manager (GAM)
• AppLovin MAX (mediation)
• Prebid Mobile (header‑bidding)
• Demand partners / DSPs via MAX and Prebid (AppLovin, Unity Ads, ironSource, InMobi, PubMatic, Smaato, Vungle, and others)
• RevenueCat (iOS subscription management, where applicable)
• Payment processors (Google Play / Apple App Store)
Each SDK may collect identifiers, device data, IP address and event data; their collection and use is governed by their own policies. We recommend reviewing their privacy statements for precise details. Our Privacy Policy discloses the categories of data shared and the purposes.

10. LOCAL‑ONLY DATA (ROOM DB / DEVICE STORAGE)
By design, your contact imports, call notes, call outcomes, and local coins ledger are stored locally. Unless you enable an explicit cloud‑backup feature (which will be opt‑in and clearly described), these items remain on your device and are not uploaded to our servers. If you enable backup, we will request separate consent and disclose the backup storage provider and retention.

11. DATA RETENTION
Server‑side (Firebase / Firestore)
• Authentication data and profile: retained until account deletion or de‑provision.
• Subscription & purchase records: retained as needed for billing reconciliation and regulatory compliance (typically up to 7 years, subject to applicable law).
• Analytics & crash logs: retained per Firebase default retention policies (you may request deletion).
Local device
• Contacts, notes, and coin balance remain until user deletes them or uninstalls the App.
Ad partners: retention per their policies; logs used for ad reporting and fraud prevention may be retained by those partners independently.

12. DATA SHARING & INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited technical data with:
• Advertising and mediation partners for ad delivery and auctioning
• Analytics and crash reporting services
• Payment processors for purchase validation
• Legal authorities when required by law
These partners may be located in the U.S., EU, India, Singapore and other jurisdictions; by using the App you consent to cross‑border transfer where necessary. Where required by law, we implement appropriate safeguards.

13. SECURITY MEASURES
We implement reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards, including:
• HTTPS / TLS for all network traffic
• Firebase App Check to mitigate abuse
• Firestore security rules and authenticated endpoints
• Encryption at rest for sensitive server data (where feasible)
• Secure token verification for rewarded ad validation
• Rate limiting and anomaly detection for anti‑fraud
ISMS and penetration testing schedules should be performed as part of internal security hygiene.

14. USER RIGHTS & HOW TO EXERCISE THEM
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights:
• Access — Request a copy of account profile information
• Correction — Request changes to inaccurate information
• Deletion — Request deletion of server‑side account data
• Portability — Request export of account profile data (not device contacts/notes unless backup enabled)
• Restriction/Objection — Object to certain processing, including profiling for advertising
• Opt‑out — Opt out of targeted advertising (via app settings or device settings)
To exercise rights, contact: support@dialmaster.in. We may verify identity to prevent unauthorized requests.

15. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
DialMaster is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under the applicable age is using the App, contact support to remove the data.

16. COOKIES, TRACKING & AD IDENTIFIERS
This is a mobile app — browser cookies are not used except where webviews are present. SDKs and ad partners use mobile identifiers (GAID/IDFA) and similar signals. You can reset or limit these identifiers from your device settings and select non‑personalized ads in our consent settings.

17. PURCHASES, SUBSCRIPTIONS & BILLING
Purchases take place through platform billing (Google Play or Apple App Store). We receive purchase tokens and subscription status for entitlement. Refunds are handled by the corresponding platform; consult Play Store / App Store for refund processes.

18. REWARDS, COINS & FRAUD PREVENTION
• 1 coin = 1 contact import (as per PRD)
• Rewarded ads grant coins (e.g., 1 rewarded ad = 50 coins) — configuration visible in the app
• Coins are non‑transferable and non‑refundable
• Fraudulent behavior (e.g., reward spoofing) will result in coin reversal, suspension or account termination

19. ACCOUNT DELETION, DATA EXPORT & PORTABILITY
To delete your account and server‑side data: contact support@dialmaster.in with subject “Delete My Account”. We will remove server‑side profile data within a reasonable timeframe; device‑local data must be removed by uninstalling the App or using the app’s local delete features. If backup is enabled, deletion will include backed‑up copies per backup provider policies.

20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & DISCLAIMERS
DialMaster provides tools that help launch calls via the device dialer; we do not guarantee call completion, successful connections, or call charges. We disclaim liability for:
• Third‑party network failures
• Inaccurate contact lists supplied by users
• Regulatory compliance of user calling practices (spam/consent)
Users must comply with local telemarketing laws and obtain consent where required.

21. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update the Policy to reflect product changes, legal requirements or partner updates. Material changes will be communicated via the App and the “Last Updated” date will be revised.
