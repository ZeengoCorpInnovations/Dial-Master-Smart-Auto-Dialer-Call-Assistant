    <section id="acceptance">
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you") and the developer of DialMaster – Smart Auto Dialer & Call Assistant ("DialMaster", "we", "us", or "Developer"). By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all incorporated policies, including our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="eligibility">
      <h2>2. Eligibility & Account Creation</h2>
      <p>Eligibility: You must be at least the minimum age required by local law to form a binding contract (typically 16 or 18 depending on jurisdiction) to use this App. By using the App you represent and warrant that you meet the eligibility requirements in your jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Account creation: To access certain features (subscriptions, purchases, coin management), you must sign in using Google Sign‑In. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during registration and to maintain and promptly update your account information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="accounts">
      <h2>3. Account Security & Google Sign‑In</h2>
      <p>Authentication: The App uses Google Sign‑In and Firebase Authentication to create and manage your account. You authorize us to access the information provided by Google for account identification (e.g., Google account ID, email, display name).</p>
      <p>Account security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify support immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="user-resp">
      <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>As a condition of using DialMaster, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comply with all applicable local, national and international laws and regulations, including telemarketing, spam and privacy laws.</li>
        <li>Obtain any necessary consent from persons you contact using the App, where required by law.</li>
        <li>Use contact import and dialing features only for lawful, permitted purposes and not for harassment, stalking, deception or illegal telemarketing.</li>
        <li>Be solely responsible for the content of the contact lists you import and for verifying the accuracy of contact details before dialing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="call-disclaimer">
      <h2>5. Call Functionality & ACTION_DIAL Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>DialMaster launches calls using your device's native dialer via the <code>ACTION_DIAL</code> intent. The App does not place calls automatically or in the background; you must confirm and initiate each call. We do not access or store your call logs or record call audio.</p>
      <p>Call charges, network quality and call outcomes are controlled by your carrier and the recipient's carrier. DialMaster is not responsible for call charges, failed connections, or any results of your calls.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="contacts">
      <h2>6. Contact Import & Call Consent</h2>
      <p>Importing contacts: You can import contacts via CSV/XLSX files or device contacts (with your permission). Imported contacts and call notes are stored locally on your device unless you opt into cloud backup.</p>
      <p>Consent to call: You are responsible for ensuring you have the legal right and consent to contact the people whose details you import. We do not verify permissions on your behalf.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="payments">
      <h2>7. Payments, Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
      <p>Payments: All in‑app purchases and subscriptions are processed by the platform billing services (Google Play or Apple App Store). By purchasing, you agree to the store’s terms and to our verification process.</p>
      <p>Subscription behavior:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Auto‑renewal: Subscription plans automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless canceled through the platform store.</li>
        <li>Price changes: We may change subscription prices. Price changes for existing subscribers will be communicated in advance and require your consent where required by law.</li>
        <li>Cancellation: You can cancel auto‑renewal through your account page on the platform store. Cancellation does not necessarily entitle you to a refund for the current billing period.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Payment verification: We request and store purchase tokens to verify entitlements and guard against fraud.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="refunds">
      <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Platform refunds: Refunds for purchases and subscriptions are handled by Google Play and Apple App Store. Please contact the platform store to initiate a refund. We may assist in refund-related inquiries but do not control platform refund decisions.</p>
      <p>Developer refunds: In exceptional cases and at our sole discretion, we may issue refunds directly. Such refunds are subject to verification and may be declined if fraud or abuse is suspected.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="coins">
      <h2>9. Coins System Rules</h2>
      <p>Coins are DialMaster’s internal, virtual currency used to import contacts and access certain features. By using the App you agree to the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Value: 1 coin = 1 contact import (subject to the App’s current configuration).</li>
        <li>Acquisition: Coins may be acquired by purchase, rewarded ads, or promotional grants.</li>
        <li>Non-transferability: Coins are non‑transferable between users and may not be redeemed for cash.</li>
        <li>Non‑refundable: Coins are non‑refundable except where required by law or as expressly determined by us.</li>
        <li>Revocation: We reserve the right to deduct coins, reverse coin grants, or suspend accounts in the event of fraud, manipulation, or abuse.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ads-terms">
      <h2>10. Ads & Rewarded Ads — Rules & Fraud Handling</h2>
      <p>Ad experience: The free tier of the App displays ads from third‑party providers. Rewarded ads are optional and provide coins when completed; they are governed by ad partner policies and may occasionally be unavailable.</p>
      <p>Fraud & validation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We validate rewarded ad completions using ad partner tokens and server‑side checks. If validation fails, coin grants may be withheld or reversed.</li>
        <li>Attempting to spoof ad completions, manipulate SDKs, or use automated tools to generate rewards is strictly prohibited and may result in suspension or termination.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ad content: We do not control the content of ads served by third parties. We disclaim responsibility for the content, accuracy, or legality of any third‑party advertisements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="prohibited">
      <h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>You must not use DialMaster for any unlawful or harmful purpose. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mass unsolicited telemarketing (spam) or harassment.</li>
        <li>Political or fraudulent telemarketing where local law requires special registration.</li>
        <li>Violating do‑not‑call lists, telemarketing restrictions, or other legal requirements.</li>
        <li>Attempting to reverse‑engineer, decompile or circumvent app protections.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="termination">
      <h2>12. Termination & Suspension</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your account, access, or use of the App, at our sole discretion and without notice, for reasons including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violation of these Terms.</li>
        <li>Evidence of fraud, reward manipulation, or tampering with purchases.</li>
        <li>Abusive or illegal usage (spam, harassment, regulated telemarketing without authorization).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Effect of termination: Upon termination, your access to the App’s paid features will cease. Server‑side account data may be retained for a limited period to comply with legal obligations and fraud prevention; local device data is unaffected by server termination but may be inaccessible without an active account in some cases.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="liability">
      <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DIALMASTER AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="ip">
      <h2>15. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All rights, title and interest in and to the App, including code, designs, graphics, trademarks, logos and content, are and will remain the exclusive property of the Developer or its licensors.

      <p>Dispute resolution: In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties will attempt to resolve the dispute informally by good‑faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, the dispute shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered in New Delhi, India, under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (or its successor), or submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in New Delhi where arbitration is not available.
